# INTRODUCTION
Information Technology has taken over all sectors, and we are constantly
drifting towards the mobile era. The number of mobile phone users is greater
than desktop users. While mobile devices like laptops, and tablets made it
possible to work on the go, now workers can use their applications on their
mobile devices to take advantage of business capabilities and insights.
Our Project, Document Management System Android Application will offer itsâ€™
users, i.e. the employees of Podar Mills various benefits. Currently, the system
is manual. This restricts access to information and documents to the workplace
only. Since the employees at Podar Mills have to quite often commute between
offices and various other places the application will offer the information at the
fingertips of the user. It will allow employees to improve quality of service to
customers by giving them access to the relevant information quickly. Having
information at the fingerts helps mobile workers deepen business relationships
and response times. This application makes it easy for employees to enter all
relevant data easily as they gather it in the field without computing the data into
back end systems (potentially making errors along the way).
Currently, the system will be hosted through the Android application but later
on can be expanded to iOS and web application as Firebase offers crossplatform
connectivity. At a time, the application will support 100 simultaneous
users and 5GB of document storage.
